# ISO20022 Message Generator

This project is a GO Module for generating and parsing ISO20022 messages. It provides a library for programmatic use.

## Fedwire Payments

This project can be used to generate the message content for US payment rails which are operated by the Federal Reserve and utilize the ISO 20022 Messaging standard. However, the message envelope format for Payment Rails is proprietary. Users must obtain the necessary proprietary XSD files from the Federal Reserve and integrate them to create complete messages. This project does not include any proprietary information or files.

For more information on Fedwire's ISO 20022 implementation and to access the required files, please visit the [Federal Reserve ISO 20022 Implementation Center](https://www.frbservices.org/resources/financial-services).
